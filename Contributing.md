Hello from ChainX!

For all product or technical questions, please review or post to ChainX's developer support center.

ChainX uses Github issues to track bugs in ChainX Core. If you have a bug to report, please check ChainX's developer support center first to see if it's already under discussion by the ChainX community, then check the open issues list to see whether it has already been reported there.

Pull requests may not receive the attention they deserve, since we are a focused team with a product roadmap. However, if you have found a way to help out the ChainX Core community by submitting a bugfix, we'll do our best to work with you to get your code merged.
